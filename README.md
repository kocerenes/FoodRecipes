 ## Tech stack
* âœ… MVVM with Clean Architecture
* âœ… [Kotlin Flow][31] - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* âœ… [LiveData][23] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* âœ… [Coroutines][51] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* âœ… [Navigation Component][24] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation. asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Safe-Args][25] - For passing data between destinations
* âœ… [Dagger-Hilt][93] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* âœ… [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Retrofit][90]- Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
* âœ… [OkHttp][23] - Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
* âœ… [Coil][92] - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
* âœ… [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* âœ… [Data Binding][85] - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* âœ… [Lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
* âœ… [Room][12] - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* âœ… [DataStore][14] - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
* âœ… [Jsoup][13] - It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.
